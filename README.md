## Objective:
Conducted a comprehensive analysis of iPhone sales data to explore relationships between product pricing, discounts, customer ratings, and reviews, aimed at identifying key sales trends.

## Tools & Technologies:
Python, Pandas, Plotly, FPDF, Matplotlib

## Key Contributions:

### Data Analysis:
Used Pandas to clean, filter, and manipulate data, extracting key metrics such as sale prices, discount percentages, and product ratings.

### Visualizations:

Developed interactive visualizations (scatter plots, bar charts, line graphs) using Plotly and Matplotlib to highlight trends between sale prices, number of ratings, and discount percentages.

Generated scatter plots with OLS trendlines to analyze relationships between sales prices and customer engagement (ratings).
Created bar charts to compare the number of ratings across various iPhone models and line graphs to showcase changes in discount percentages and sale prices.

### Automation: 
Automated the creation of a PDF report using the FPDF library, summarizing the key findings, including the most and least expensive products, and the correlation between product pricing and customer ratings.

### Insights: 
Discovered that products with lower prices tend to receive more ratings, and higher discounts were often linked to increased customer engagement.

## Impact:

Automated reporting reduced manual effort, improving efficiency.
Generated insights into pricing and customer behavior that can help optimize future product launches and marketing strategies.
